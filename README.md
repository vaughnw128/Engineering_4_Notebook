## Hello Raspberry Pi Zero

### Description
The purpose of this assignment was to familiarize ourselves with the Raspberry Pi hardware and using the terminal window to create a hello world message.

### Materials Used
* 1 USB Hub
* 1 Raspberry Pi Zero
* 1 VGA Cable
* 1 VGA to Mini HDMI
* 2 Micro USB cables

### Process
Our process was very simple. Vaughn and I are sharing a pi so its easier to progress and we need two separate computers to read the instructions on one and do work on the other. We first set up our components, and with Jack's help we reconfigured the wiring so we don't have to plug in the USB Hub underneath the table. After that we set up the terminal window and followed the instructions to create our program, and to repeat the message 10 times we used a for loop.

## Hello Mathematica

### Description
In this assignment we were directed to the Mathematica software loaded onto our Pi, which is essentially a calculator that you can run on your Pi. We used this program to run some basic calculations and also do some integrations and graphing across an interval. Pretty cool!

### Materials Used
* 1 USB Hub
* 1 Raspberry Pi Zero
* 1 VGA Cable
* 1 VGA to Mini HDMI
* 2 Micro USB cables

### Process
This was super straightforward. All we had to do was open the Mathematica window in the Pi after setting it up for the day and then we were able to write our code. The basic functions were easy to understand, and after playing with the lists and plots we understood those as well pretty quickly.

## Hello Python

### Description
The purpose of this assignment was to use our Pi to program in the Python IDE that is installed. The first challenge is to create an automatic dice roller in Python.

### Materials Used
* 1 USB Hub
* 1 Raspberry Pi Zero
* 1 VGA Cable
* 1 VGA to Mini HDMI
* 2 Micro USB cables

### Process
Rather than using the Python IDE we are writing in our command mode because Vaughn doesn't like the Python shell. We were able to easily configure the Hello World statement and using randint and a while loop we blew through the dice roller challenge.

## Python Program 01

### Description
The purpose of this assignment is to write a program that returns the sum, difference, quotient, and modulo of the two numbers after asking the user to input those two numbers.
 
### Materials Used
* 1 USB Hub
* 1 Raspberry Pi Zero
* 1 VGA Cable
* 1 VGA to Mini HDMI
* 2 Micro USB cables

### Process
juice

## Python Program 02

### Description
Write a simple program that solves quadratic functions

### Materials Used
* 1 USB Hub
* 1 Raspberry Pi Zero
* 1 VGA Cable
* 1 VGA to Mini HDMI
* 2 Micro USB cables

### Process
We basically wrote a program to separate out a b and c in the quadratic and plug it into the discriminant to solve it.

## Hangman

### Description
Write a hangman game with a little graphic

### Materials Used
* 1 USB Hub
* 1 Raspberry Pi Zero
* 1 VGA Cable
* 1 VGA to Mini HDMI
* 2 Micro USB cables

### Process
This one was cool. Seems really hard on the surface in my eyes, but once you get down to it, it's real easy. Started out writing a function to update the display at the start of every guess by running a for loop through a list that had the elements be equal to what I wanted displayed. Then it would let a person guess and see if the the guess was contained in the string, and then checked the score. All in all, pretty easy.

## Flask GPIO

### Description
Make a website turn LEDs on and off

### Materials Used
* 1 USB Hub
* 1 Raspberry Pi Zero
* 1 VGA Cable
* 1 VGA to Mini HDMI
* 2 Micro USB cables

### Process 
We took two images to use as buttons, and then modeled the code somewhat around the base code, but made it so we could take in the button press as form inputs rather than checking for GET vs POST data. It took a lot of editing, but it ended up happening, and works just how we wanted it to.
